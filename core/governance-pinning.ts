/**
 * G2: governance pinning.
 *
 * The gap. `ReversibleContext.project()` selects segments purely by weight, so a
 * governance constraint competes for the token budget against the active task
 * state — and a constraint is old, off-topic, and low-salience next to the
 * current sub-goal. That is precisely the mechanism the Governance Decay work
 * (arXiv 2606.22528) measures: compaction raises the violation rate from 0% to
 * 30% (up to 59%), because compaction is engineered for task continuity and
 * treats standing policy as evictable content.
 *
 * Craft is exposed on exactly the channels the paper finds vulnerable. Its
 * threat model explicitly excludes the system message — frameworks that preserve
 * it "simply protect one channel while leaving memory and conversation-carried
 * governance exposed" — and `agent-loop.ts` has no system channel at all, so
 * governance necessarily arrives through memory, tool output, or a user turn:
 * the three channels measured at +45, +33 and +50 points of decay, against +0
 * for the preserved system message.
 *
 * The fix is not a better summary. It is to remove the constraint from the
 * eviction competition entirely, and to make that guarantee checkable rather
 * than trusted.
 *
 * Design rule, inherited from `agent-loop.ts`: a guard must be an explicit
 * ceiling owned by Craft, never a prompt instruction the model could
 * reinterpret. So a pinned constraint is *data*, and whether it survived is
 * decided by comparing content against a recorded digest — not by asking.
