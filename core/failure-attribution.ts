/**
 * G3: failure attribution.
 *
 * The gap this closes. Craft's receipts already carry per-memory `reason`,
 * `omitted_count` and `retrieval_mode`, and v0.12.36 now produces a
 * deterministic verdict — so the *raw material* for diagnosis exists. What was
 * missing was the layer that turns those observations into a named conclusion.
 * Without it, "the agent got it wrong" is a single undifferentiated fact, and a
 * lesson drawn from it cannot be checked against the cause it claims.
 *
 * The taxonomy is taken from the Eywa memory report (2026), which argues that a
 * single end-to-end score cannot distinguish which layer failed: a wrong answer
 * may come from missing evidence, unsupported extraction, stale state, retrieval
 * loss, or the answer model itself. Each of those needs a different fix, so
 * conflating them makes the failure unlearnable.
 *
 * The rule that shapes this whole module: **attribution is derived from
 * observations, never asserted.** A caller supplies what was observed, and the
 * module either names a cause that the observations support or returns
 * `unattributed`. Guessing a plausible cause is worse than admitting ignorance,
 * because a wrong cause produces a confident, useless, and permanently repeated
 * lesson.
