/**
 * A held-out evaluation suite over Craft's own sub-capabilities.
 *
 * Why this exists as a kernel rather than a script. The project already has
 * `delivery_evaluation_case` with a `held_out` partition and a sanitized
 * requirement, and `EvalCampaignKernel` over it — but that campaign is built for
 * A/B comparison of two harnesses, so it needs a baseline and a candidate arm and
 * cannot answer "how good is this build on its own". Inventing a second
 * incompatible mechanism would repeat the mistake this codebase keeps catching,
 * so this reuses the same *contract* (held-out, sanitized, independently
 * approved, content-addressed, no promotion authority) for absolute
 * measurement.
 *
 * Three rules make the numbers mean something:
 *
 * 1. **Deterministic grading only.** Every case is decided from bytes by the
 *    v0.12.36 sensor vocabulary. A model judging its own output, or an LLM
 *    judge, is not reproducible and would make a score unfalsifiable.
 * 2. **`inconclusive` is never a pass.** A case that could not be observed is
 *    reported separately and excluded from the numerator, the same discipline
 *    the verification sensor applies to `blocked`.
 * 3. **The sample size travels with every rate.** `3/4` is not "75% ability";
 *    it is four observations. The summary always carries `total`, so a rate can
 *    never be quoted without its denominator.

/**
 * The ledgers a measurement can belong to.

 * `capability` answers "can the system do it": retrieval works, the fact reaches

 *

 * compliance is not value. A system can refuse every forbidden action and still
 * be useless or cold to the person using it.
 *
 * `value` answers "does it help the person": is this relevant, understood,
 * natural, worth continuing.
 *
 * They must never be added together. A pipeline reaching 100% says nothing about
 * whether the person on the other end benefited — that conflation is how a
 * project ends up with an all-green report and an unhappy user.
 *
 * The distinction between `safety` and `value` is the same one, applied to the
 * ledger that is easiest to fake. Filing a compliance check under `value` because
 * it happens to observe model output would let the suite report a value result
 * it never measured — which is precisely the overclaim these ledgers exist to
