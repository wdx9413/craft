/**
 * V1: a deterministic verification sensor.
 *
 * The gap this closes: Craft records whether work was *governed* (evidence,
 * signoffs, approvals) but never established whether the work was *correct*
 * without a human or a model asserting it. `decideExperienceCapture` weights a
 * failure at 30 points, yet the failure signal had to be supplied by the caller
 * as `outcome`. A loop therefore could not learn from its own mistakes, because
 * it was never told which ones they were.
 *
 * The design rule is taken from harness engineering: a sensor that cannot say
 * whether its own signal is real is not a closed loop, it only moves the noise
 * earlier. So every check here is *deterministic* — it is computed from
 * observable facts (an exit code, an exact expected string, a content digest)
 * and never from a model's opinion or the agent's own claim of success.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: any LLM judge, any "the model said it worked" path, and
 * any scoring that a caller can inflate. A check that cannot be evaluated
 * deterministically is reported as `inconclusive`, not as a pass — the fail
 * direction is the safe one.
