/**
 * G1: cross-trajectory abstraction.
 *
 * The gap this closes. Craft captured experience one trajectory at a time:
 * `decideExperienceCapture` scored a single run's outcome, retries and
 * corrections, and `buildExperienceRecord` produced one record per run. Nothing
 * ever looked *across* runs. So Craft had the Reflection stage of the memory
 * literature and none of the Experience stage — it could record that a run went
 * badly, but never that twelve runs went badly the *same* way.
 *
 * Why that matters more than it sounds: a per-run lesson is only useful to the
 * run that produced it. The value of memory is that the thirteenth attempt
 * starts smarter than the first. That requires generalising over trajectories,
 * which is exactly what was missing.
 *
 * The hard part is not clustering, it is *deserving* to generalise. An
 * over-eager abstraction is indistinguishable from a confident hallucination,
 * and it would poison every future run that trusts it. So the rules here are
 * deliberately strict:
 *
 *   1. Recurrence must be observed across trajectories that are **independent**
 *      — distinct traces, and for a stronger claim, distinct tasks. Three
 *      attempts at the same task in one trace is one story told three times.
 *   2. Generalisation happens over a **deterministic signature**, never over
 *      free text. The signature is derived from failure shape (which checks
 *      failed, how often, in what order), so two runs group together only when
 *      they failed the *same way* by a rule anyone can re-run.
 *   3. Below the evidence floor the function returns **no abstraction**, not a
 *      weaker one. "Not enough evidence" is a legitimate, expected answer.
