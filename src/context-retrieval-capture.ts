/**
 * v0.12.34 ideal-state gap closure.
 *
 * Three gaps were identified by comparing Craft against first-party industry
 * sources (notably Anthropic's Managed Agents post, 2026-04-08, and the
 * Contextual Retrieval post, 2024-09-19). Each was a *shape* problem, not a
 * missing capability:
 *
 *  1. Context management could only truncate. `truncateToBudget` is one-way:
 *     once tokens are gone they cannot come back. Managed Agents calls this out
 *     directly — "irreversible decisions to selectively retain or discard
 *     context can lead to failures. It is difficult to know which tokens the
 *     future turns will need." This module adds a *reversible* context object:
 *     the original is retained and only the *projection* shrinks.
 *
 *  2. Lexical retrieval had no IDF weighting and no identifier awareness. Craft
 *     stores digests, ticket ids and record kinds — exactly the content an
 *     embedding model is worst at. Contextual Retrieval reports contextual
 *     embeddings + contextual BM25 cutting failed retrievals by 49%, and 67%
 *     with reranking. This adds BM25 with an exact-identifier boost.
 *
 *  3. Memory and experience could only be written by an explicit tool call, so
 *     learning depended on the model choosing to remember. This adds a
 *     deterministic, auditable capture path with a confidence gate, so a lesson
 *     survives a session even when the model never asks to store it.
 *
 * Nothing here calls a model or a tokenizer, for the same reason token-budget.ts
 * does not: the decisions must be reproducible on any platform.

 * destructive one, so a later turn that turns out to need an earlier segment can
