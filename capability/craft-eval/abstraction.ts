/**
 * Verifies the abstraction path with genuine recurrence, using the live model
 * where a real failure occurs and observed evidence where it does not.
 *
 * The live runs established something worth stating plainly: `deepseek-v4.1-flash`
 * passes the deterministic cases, so no abstraction is the *correct* answer for
 * them. Refusing to invent a pattern is the feature working, not the feature
 * failing to fire.
 *
 * So this script drives the same code path with the model's one *reproducible*
 * real failure — case-folding on reversed strings, observed twice in run 1 and
 * run 2 — replicated across independent tasks. The failure signature is real and
 * observed; only the replication is synthetic, and the output says so.
 *
 * No model call, so no credential is needed:
 *   node --experimental-strip-types eval/abstraction.ts
